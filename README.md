# ezTravel_Integrated Marketing Campaign
This project is from a capstone project conducted at Fu Jen Catholic University (Department of Advertising &amp; Public Relations). It presents a comprehensive marketing campaign for ezTravel, Taiwan’s first online travel agency. The materials include an IMC proposal, quantitative and qualitative research reports, and online campaign video.


# Project Overview
This campaign focuses on revitalizing ezTravel’s brand perception among 18–24-year-old university students, a potential but underdeveloped segment. The overall goal is to increase young consumers’ understanding, preference, and usage of ezTravel through creative online and offline marketing strategies.


# Research Objectives
- Assess ezTravel’s brand awareness and perception among young consumers.
- Identify key factors affecting platform choice and travel behavior.
- Compare ezTravel with major competitors (KKday, Klook).
- Develop strategies to build stronger emotional connections with youth travelers.


# Methodology
**Quantitative**: Conducted a large-scale survey (n>200) of university students aged 18–24 to analyze ezTravel’s brand awareness, perception, and positioning using descriptive statistics and perceptual mapping. (See attachment: Quantitative Report)

**Qualitative**: Conducted focus groups to explore emotional associations and attitudes toward ezTravel and competitors, uncovering insights on travel habits and preferences to refine messaging. (See attachment: Qualitative Report)


# Brief Marketing and Brand Analysis
- **Strengths**: Comprehensive one-stop platform, wide product variety (flights, hotels, local experiences).
- **Weaknesses**: Perceived as old-fashioned and lacking youthful appeal.
- **Opportunities**: Post-pandemic travel rebound and growing domestic tourism market.
- **Threats**: Intense competition from modernized OTAs like KKday and Klook.
- **Brand Position**: Rationally strong but emotionally weak; consumers recognize ezTravel’s convenience but feel little excitement or emotional connection to it.


# Brief Target Audience Analysis
Target audience: “Easy-going Travel Buddies” — 18–24-year-old university students who:
- Value convenience and spontaneity over detailed pre-planning.
- Enjoy traveling with friends to create shared memories.
- Prefer lighthearted, flexible, and affordable domestic trips.
- Use social media actively and respond to relatable, fun, and emotionally resonant brand communication.


# Key Findings
- 61.9% have heard of ezTravel, but only 11.9% have ever used it.
- ezTravel scores high on rational benefits (convenience, diversity of services) but low on emotional appeal.
- Youth travelers associate ezTravel with older generations and lack understanding of its updated offerings.
- The main opportunity lies in repositioning ezTravel as “the easy, fun way to travel with friends.”

# Brief Marketing Strategies (More details are in the main IMC proposal)
- Rebrand ezTravel as a lighthearted, one-stop travel partner that helps young people easily plan trips and enjoy shared experiences.
- **Online activations**: Social media posts, short-form videos, meme-style OTV ads, and IG filter games.
- **Offline activations**: Campus pop-up experiences and interactive exhibition zones.
- **Goal**: Increase brand understanding, emotional connection, and platform engagement among university students.
